Earth day doesn't necessarily last only 24 hours. Some people take the time to make a bigger change, something along the lines of planting trees or other various plants over a week or maybe even a month.

There are many ways you can also participate in Earth day, whether it be donating to one of many non-profit organizations or picking up some plastic waste. If you want you can even create a garden for yourself or go for a walk in a forest to enjoy Earth.
