    This year's Earth Day is going to be held over many video calls because of the current outbreak causing us to social distance but it doesn't have to stop you from learning. Just from being home for so long animals and life is coming back to certain areas, water is cleaner in some places too. For this year's earth day you can still go out and join a cleaning group, but don't forget to come prepared wearing protective clothing. You can even put a sign in your window and not go out at all. You can choose how you want to spend your Earth Day.
